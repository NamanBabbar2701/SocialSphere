# 📱 SocialSphere – A Facebook-like Social Media Web App
**SocialSphere** is a text-based social media web application built using Java EE technologies — Servlets, JSP, and JDBC. It mimics the core functionality of Facebook, allowing users to register, log in, create posts, and comment on others’ posts. All data is managed using an H2 relational database, and the application runs on the Apache Tomcat server.
